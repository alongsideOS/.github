# Hi, welcome to Alongside AI ðŸ‘‹

We are trying to define how an AI and humans work together and be productive together. We believe that AI is not meant to be a temple where you worship a few times a day, by taking the effort to do so. 

We believe that AI is meant to work alongside humans.

Ultimately our vision at **alongsideOS** is for the AI to be ~~_part of the operating system_~~ the operating system. 

This is what the japanese called _tsukumogami_
